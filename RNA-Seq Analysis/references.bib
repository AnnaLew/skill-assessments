  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review the literature to determine the
              incidence and prevalence of autism in epilepsy and epilepsy in
              autism, conditions that are often comorbid. METHODS: We adhered
              to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
              and Meta-Analyses) standards, and the protocol was registered
              with PROSPERO. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane
              Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from inception until
              July 4, 2016. Studies were included if they reported an incidence
              or prevalence of autism in epilepsy or epilepsy in autism. These
              estimates were described using mean, standard deviation, median,
              and interquartile range. RESULTS: Seventy-four studies reporting
              on 283,549 patients were included. The median overall period
              prevalence of epilepsy in people with autism was 12.1\% while the
              median overall period prevalence of autism in people with
              epilepsy was 9.0\% when including all population types. When
              excluding studies that investigated patients with syndromic
              epilepsy or developmental delay, the median overall period
              prevalence of epilepsy in people with autism was 11.2\% while the
              median overall period prevalence of autism in people with
              epilepsy was 8.1\%. We observed trends for sex as the prevalence
              of autism in epilepsy was higher in males while the prevalence of
              epilepsy in autism was higher in females. It is important to
              interpret these estimates with caution, as there was significant
              heterogeneity between studies. Meta-regression found no
              association between study quality and prevalence or incidence
              estimates (all p-values > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The period
              prevalence of epilepsy in people with autism, and vice versa, was
              consistently higher than previously reported estimates of the
              occurrence of these disorders in the general population. These
              findings highlight the importance of screening for autism in
              people who have epilepsy and epilepsy in people who have autism
              and may help shed light on shared pathogenesis between these

              coordinators of biological and cellular processes. Characterizing
              lncRNA expression across cells and tissues is key to
              understanding their role in determining phenotypes including
              human diseases. We present here FC-R2, a comprehensive expression
              atlas across a broadly-defined human transcriptome, inclusive of
              over 109,000 coding and non-coding genes, as described in the
              FANTOM CAGE-Associated Transcriptome (FANTOM-CAT) study. This
              atlas greatly extends the gene annotation used in the original
              recount2 resource. We demonstrate the utility of the FC-R2 atlas
              by reproducing key findings from published large studies and by
              generating new results across normal and diseased human samples.
              In particular, we (a) identify tissue specific transcription
              profiles for distinct classes of coding and non-coding genes, (b)
              perform differential expression analyses across thirteen cancer
              types, providing new insights linking promoter and enhancer
              lncRNAs expression to tumor pathogenesis, and (c) confirm the
              prognostic value of several enhancers in cancer. Comprised of
              over 70,000 samples, the FC-R2 atlas will empower other

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing is a flexible and powerful
              new approach for measuring gene, exon, or isoform expression. To
              maximize the utility of RNA sequencing data, new statistical
              methods are needed for clustering, differential expression, and
              other analyses. A major barrier to the development of new
              statistical methods is the lack of RNA sequencing datasets that
              can be easily obtained and analyzed in common statistical
              software packages such as R. To speed up the development process,
              we have created a resource of analysis-ready RNA-sequencing
              datasets. 2 DESCRIPTION: ReCount is an online resource of RNA-seq
              gene count tables and auxilliary data. Tables were built from raw
              RNA sequencing data from 18 different published studies
              comprising 475 samples and over 8 billion reads. Using the Myrna
              package, reads were aligned, overlapped with gene models and
              tabulated into gene-by-sample count tables that are ready for
              statistical analysis. Count tables and phenotype data were
              combined into Bioconductor ExpressionSet objects for ease of
              analysis. ReCount also contains the Myrna manifest files and R
              source code used to process the samples, allowing statistical and
              computational scientists to consider alternative parameter
              values. 3 CONCLUSIONS: By combining datasets from many studies
              and providing data that has already been processed from. fastq
              format into ready-to-use. RData and. txt files, ReCount
              facilitates analysis and methods development for RNA-seq count
              data. We anticipate that ReCount will also be useful for
              investigators who wish to consider cross-study comparisons and
              alternative normalization strategies for RNA-seq.",

  abstract = "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common, highly heritable
              neurodevelopmental condition characterized by marked genetic
              heterogeneity. Thus, a fundamental question is whether autism
              represents an aetiologically heterogeneous disorder in which the
              myriad genetic or environmental risk factors perturb common
              underlying molecular pathways in the brain. Here, we demonstrate
              consistent differences in transcriptome organization between
              autistic and normal brain by gene co-expression network analysis.
              Remarkably, regional patterns of gene expression that typically
              distinguish frontal and temporal cortex are significantly
              attenuated in the ASD brain, suggesting abnormalities in cortical
              patterning. We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed
              genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for
              known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal
              specific splicing factor A2BP1 (also known as FOX1), and a module
              enriched for immune genes and glial markers. Using
              high-throughput RNA sequencing we demonstrate dysregulated
              splicing of A2BP1-dependent alternative exons in the ASD brain.
              Moreover, using a published autism genome-wide association study
              (GWAS) data set, we show that the neuronal module is enriched for
              genetically associated variants, providing independent support
              for the causal involvement of these genes in autism. In contrast,
              the immune-glial module showed no enrichment for autism GWAS
              signals, indicating a non-genetic aetiology for this process.
              Collectively, our results provide strong evidence for convergent
              molecular abnormalities in ASD, and implicate transcriptional and
              splicing dysregulation as underlying mechanisms of neuronal
              dysfunction in this disorder.",

              symptoms in any psychiatric or neurodevelopemental condition and

              all their possible combinations, render limitless variety of

              literature has been emphasizing the importance of environmental

              autoimmune process attracting the most attention. This study
              provides a review of the autoimmune involvement in the
              pathogenesis of ASD. The\textbackslashr\textbackslashnmicrobiome,
              the representative of the innate immune system in the central
              nervous system (CNS), plays a critical role in triggering
              inflammation. Besides, a bidirectional communicational pathway
              between the CNS and the intestine called the gut‑brain‑axis is
              linked to the development of ASD. Moreover, the higher plasma
              level of pro‑inflammatory cytokines in ASD patients and the
              higher prevalence of autoimmune disorders in the first‑degree
              family members of affected persons are other clues of the immune

              including resveratrol and palmitoylethanolamide have shown
              promising effects by relieving the manifestations of ASD.
              Although considerable advances have been made in elucidating the
              role of autoimmunity in the ASD pathogenesis, further studies

  abstract = "Abstract The usability of publicly-available gene expression data
              is often limited by the availability of high-quality,
              standardized biological phenotype and experimental condition
              information (``metadata''). We released the recount2 project,
              which involved re-processing ∼70,000 samples in the Sequencing
              Read Archive (SRA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and The
              Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) projects. While samples from the
              latter two projects are well-characterized with extensive
              metadata, the ∼50,000 RNA-seq samples from SRA in recount2 are
              inconsistently annotated with metadata. Tissue type, sex, and
              library type can be estimated from the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
              data itself. However, more detailed and harder to predict
              metadata, like age and diagnosis, must ideally be provided by
              labs that deposit the data.To facilitate more analyses within
              human brain tissue data, we have complemented phenotype
              predictions by manually constructing a uniformly-curated database
              of public RNA-seq samples present in SRA and recount2. We
              describe the reproducible curation process for constructing
              recount-brain that involves systematic review of the primary
              manuscript, which can serve as a guide to annotate other studies
              and tissues. We further expanded recount-brain by merging it with
              GTEx and TCGA brain samples as well as linking to controlled
              vocabulary terms for tissue, Brodmann area and disease.
              Furthermore, we illustrate how to integrate the sample metadata
              in recount-brain with the gene expression data in recount2 to
              perform differential expression analysis. We then provide three
              analysis examples involving modeling postmortem interval,
              glioblastoma, and meta-analyses across GTEx and TCGA. Overall,
              recount-brain facilitates expression analyses and improves their
              reproducibility as individual researchers do not have to manually
              curate the sample metadata. recount-brain is available via the
              add\_metadata() function from the recount Bioconductor package at
              bioconductor.org/packages/recount.",
